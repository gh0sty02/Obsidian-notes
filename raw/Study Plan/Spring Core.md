# 🚀 **Spring Core - Complete FAANG Level Roadmap**

---

## ✅ 1. **Spring Core Introduction**

- What is Spring Framework?
- Evolution of Spring
- Spring Modules (Core, Data, MVC, AOP, Security, Boot, Batch, etc.)
- Monolithic vs Microservices

> Why Important?
> This is the foundation. Expect interviewers to ask why Spring exists and how it compares to EJB/Struts.

---

## ✅ 2. **IOC (Inversion of Control) & Dependency Injection**

- What is IoC?
- ApplicationContext vs BeanFactory (Differences & Use Cases)
- DI Types:
    - Constructor Injection
    - Setter Injection
    - Field Injection (Why it’s discouraged)
- Bean Lifecycle (Creation, Initialization, Destruction)
- XML Config vs Java Config vs Annotation Config
- Spring Context Refresh Cycle (Internals)

> FAANG Focus:
> You must know the full bean lifecycle including:

- Instantiation (Reflection)
- Dependency Injection Process
- Post Processors (BeanPostProcessor, InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor)
- Sequence to remember:

```javascript
1. postProcessBeforeInstantiation() [InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor]
2. Instantiation (Reflection → Constructor called)
3. postProcessAfterInstantiation() [InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor]
4. Dependency Injection (setters/fields/constructors already resolved)
5. postProcessProperties() [InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor]
6. postProcessBeforeInitialization() [BeanPostProcessor]
7. @PostConstruct / afterPropertiesSet() / custom init()
8. postProcessAfterInitialization() [BeanPostProcessor]
```

---

## ✅ 3. **Bean Scopes (Deep Dive)**

- Singleton, Prototype, Request, Session, Global Session
- When to Use Each Scope
- Circular Dependency Handling (Singleton vs Prototype)
- Scope in Multi-threaded Applications (Why prototype in multi-threaded cases)

> FAANG Focus:
> Understand the performance and memory trade-offs of each scope.

---

## ✅ 4. **Bean Lifecycle (Real Internals)**

- `@PostConstruct`, `@PreDestroy`
- Init-method and Destroy-method (XML Config)
- Bean FactoryPostProcessor vs BeanPostProcessor
- `ApplicationContextAware`, `BeanNameAware`, `InitializingBean`, `DisposableBean`

> FAANG Focus:
> Draw a **full lifecycle flowchart** for interviews — this is heavily asked.

---

## ✅ 5. **Spring Core Annotations (Deep Understanding)**

- `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`
- `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, `@ComponentScan`
- `@Primary`, `@Qualifier`
- `@Lazy`, `@Scope`, `@Value`
- `@Profile`
- `@PropertySource`

> FAANG Focus:
> Explain annotation processing flow (how Spring detects and processes annotations internally).

---

## ✅ 6. **Bean Wiring & Autowiring (Deep Dive)**

- `@Autowired` (byType)
- `@Qualifier` (byName)
- Constructor vs Setter Autowiring vs Field
- Circular Dependency Handling 

---

## ✅ 7. **Spring Property Management**

- `application.properties` vs `application.yml`
- External Configuration (Environment Variables, System Properties)
- `@Value` Injection
- PropertySources & Environment Abstraction
- Configuration Binding (`@ConfigurationProperties`)

> FAANG Focus:
> Real-world scenario: Multiple environments (DEV, QA, PROD) and their property management.

---

## ✅ 8. **Event Handling in Spring**

- `ApplicationEvent` and `ApplicationListener`
- Custom Events
- Asynchronous Event Listeners
- Event Multicasting

---

## ✅ 9. **Spring Aware Interfaces (Deep Dive)**

- `BeanNameAware`, `BeanFactoryAware`, `ApplicationContextAware`, `ResourceLoaderAware`
- Real Use Cases in Large Systems

---

## ✅ 10. **FactoryBeans (Core Concept)**

- What is a `FactoryBean`?
- Difference Between BeanFactory and FactoryBean
- When to Use FactoryBean (Examples like SqlSessionFactoryBean)

---

## ✅ 11. **Circular Dependency Problem (Real Analysis)**

- What is Circular Dependency?
- How Spring Handles It
- When Circular Dependency Fails (Constructor Injection)
- Workarounds (`@Lazy`, `ObjectFactory`, `Proxy`, ApplicationContext injection)

---

## ✅ 12. **Post Processors (Master These!)**

- `BeanPostProcessor`
- `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`
- `InstantiationAwareBeanPostProcessor`
- `SmartLifecycle`

> FAANG Focus:
> You should know exactly **when and why** these are invoked in the lifecycle. Real examples like Property Placeholder Resolution.

---

## ✅ 13. **Annotation Processing (Deep Dive)**

- How `@ComponentScan` Works Internally
- Role of `ClassPathBeanDefinitionScanner`
- How Proxying Works (JDK Dynamic Proxy vs CGLIB)
- What is `@Enable` and ImportSelector?
- Embeddable Annotation 

> FAANG Focus:
> You should know how annotation processing works from **classpath scanning** to **bean registration**.

---

## ✅ 14. **Spring Profiles (Real-World Use)**

- What is Profile?
- `@Profile` vs Active Profiles in `application.properties`
- Multi-profile Handling

---

## ✅ 15. **Resource Management**

- `ResourceLoader` and `Resource`
- Loading Files from Classpath, FileSystem, URL
- `@PropertySource`

---

## ✅ 16. **Task Scheduling**

- `@Scheduled` and `TaskScheduler`
- Thread Pools for Scheduling
- Cron Expressions in Spring

---

## ✅ 17. **Transaction Management (Core Concepts)**

- `@Transactional` (How it works internally)
- PlatformTransactionManager
- Propagation Levels (FAANG must-know)
- Isolation Levels
- Transaction Rollback Rules
- Declarative vs Programmatic Transactions

---

## ✅ 18. **ApplicationContext Hierarchy**

- Parent-Child Contexts
- Real Scenarios (e.g., WebApplicationContext and Root ApplicationContext)
