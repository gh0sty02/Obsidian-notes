# **Elasticsearch Practice Questions**

---

## **1️⃣ Creating, Updating, and Deleting Documents**

4. Insert a new product with `name`, `brand`, `price`, `description`, `in_stock`, `release_date`.
5. Update the `price` and `in_stock` status of an existing product by its ID.
6. Upsert a product: if it exists, update its `description`; if not, create it.
7. Delete a product by ID and verify it no longer exists.

---

## **2️⃣ Match Query, Term Query, Range Query, Bool Query**

8. Write a **match query** to find products with `"gaming"` in `name`.
9. Write a **term query** to find products with `brand.keyword = "Dell"`.
10. Write a **range query** to find products with `price < 50000`.
11. Write a **bool query**: must match `"laptop"` in `name`, should match `"Dell"` or `"HP"` in brand, and filter for `in_stock = true`.

---

## **3️⃣ Sorting, Filtering, and Aggregations**

12. Retrieve products **sorted by price descending**.
13. Filter products **where in_stock = true** and `price < 50000`.
14. Create a **terms aggregation** on `brand.keyword` to count products per brand.
15. Create a **range aggregation** for `price` with ranges: `0-30000`, `30001-50000`, `50001+`.

---

## **4️⃣ Phrase Search, Wildcard, Fuzzy, Prefix, Multi-Match, Exists**

16. Write a **match_phrase query** to find `"gaming laptop"` in `description`.
