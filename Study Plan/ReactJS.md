## 🧱 **1. Fundamentals (Beginner)**

Learn the basics and build muscle memory.

### ✅ Topics:

- What is React? Why use it?
- React DOM vs React Native
- JSX – Syntax, Expressions, Nesting, Babel
- Components – Functional vs Class
- Props vs State
- useState Hook
- Event Handling in React
- Conditional Rendering
- List Rendering with `.map()`
- Basic Forms and Controlled Components

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "How would you render a list of users from an API with a loading state?"
- "How do you toggle a button between ON/OFF?"

---

## ⚙️ **2. Intermediate Concepts**

This is where React’s power comes in.

### ✅ Topics:

- **Hooks in Depth:**
    - `useEffect` – cleanup, dependency arrays, infinite loop trap
    - `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`
    - `useReducer` for complex state
- **Component Lifecycle** (for class components)
- **Context API** – avoiding prop drilling
- Lifting State Up
- Composition vs Inheritance
- React Router v6+
- Handling Forms with validation (e.g., Formik or React Hook Form)
- Basic Error Boundaries
- Basic Custom Hooks

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "How do you debounce an input field that updates state?"
- "Build a custom hook for window scroll position."

---

## 🚀 **3. Advanced React (FAANG-Level Concepts)**

### ✅ Topics:

- **React Reconciliation** and Virtual DOM
- React Fiber Architecture
- Concurrent Mode and startTransition
- React Suspense + Lazy Loading
- **Error Boundaries Deep Dive**
- **Performance Optimization:**
    - React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
    - Lazy loading images/components
    - Code Splitting
    - Reselect (for memoized selectors in Redux)
- **Render Props & HOCs**
- **Portals** (e.g., modals)
- **Refs & DOM Manipulation**
- **Forwarding Refs**
- Custom Hooks Advanced
- Strict Mode

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "Why does your component re-render even after using React.memo?"
- "Build a custom hook that handles API fetch with loading/error states."

---

## 🌐 **4. State Management**

You must know at least **2–3 tools** in depth.

### ✅ Topics:

- Context API with useReducer
- Redux (Toolkit preferred)
- Zustand, Jotai (modern alt state managers)
- Recoil (if FB-style apps)
- Redux Middlewares: thunk, saga
- Persisting State (Redux Persist)
- Global Error Handling

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "How would you design a global notification system?"
- "How to persist Redux state only for specific keys?"

---

## 🔌 **5. API & Data Fetching**

FAANG apps are **API-first**.

### ✅ Topics:

- Fetch / Axios with useEffect
- useSWR
- React Query (TanStack Query):
    - Caching, staleTime, refetching strategies
    - Pagination + Infinite Scroll
- Debouncing + Throttling API Calls
- Global API Error Handling

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "How would you show real-time status updates with polling?"
- "What caching strategies does React Query offer?"

---

## 💅 **6. Styling**

At least **3 styling approaches**.

### ✅ Topics:

- CSS Modules
- Styled-components / Emotion
- Tailwind CSS
- Inline styles
- Theme switching with Context
- Animations – Framer Motion or React Spring

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "Build a responsive card layout using Tailwind."
- "How would you design a dark mode toggle?"

---

## 🏗️ **7. Architecture & Patterns**

For building real apps, not just ToDos.

### ✅ Topics:

- Folder Structure Best Practices
- Feature-based architecture
- Reusability patterns (compound components, slot pattern)
- Service Layer (API abstraction)
- Dependency Injection (for testable code)
- Atomic Design
- Monorepo (if scale needed)

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "How would you structure a multi-role dashboard application?"
- "Break down a large component into manageable parts."

---

## 🧪 **8. Testing**

You must know **unit + integration** testing.

### ✅ Topics:

- Unit testing with **Jest**
- Component testing with **React Testing Library**
- Mocks & Spies
- Snapshot Testing
- Testing hooks and async logic
- E2E: Cypress or Playwright (basics)

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "Test a form component that conditionally renders a field."
- "How do you mock fetch inside a custom hook test?"

---

## 🌍 **9. React + TypeScript**

Industry standard.

### ✅ Topics:

- Typing Props, State, Refs
- Generics in components/hooks
- Discriminated Unions
- Extending types
- Utility Types (`Partial`, `Pick`, etc.)

### 🧪 Scenario-Based:

- "How would you type a form with dynamic fields?"
- "Make a reusable table component using generics."

---

## 📦 **10. DevOps & Deployment**

For production readiness.

### ✅ Topics:

- Create React App vs Vite vs Next.js
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Vercel, Netlify
- Webpack/Babel (basic understanding)
- Environment variables (`.env`)
- Lighthouse Performance Audit
- Bundle Analyzer
- Dockerizing React Apps

---

## 📚 **11. Interview Prep (React-Specific)**

### ✅ Focus Areas:

- Deep Dive on Reconciliation & Rendering
- Handling 1000s of DOM elements (e.g., virtualization via `react-window`)
- Memory Leaks, Cleanup
- Accessibility (a11y)
- Component Design Patterns
- SSR vs CSR vs ISR (esp. in Next.js)
- Performance Bottlenecks

---

## 💡 **12. Bonus / Real-World Projects**

Build FAANG-style mini-apps:

- Admin Dashboard (React Query + Redux Toolkit + Tailwind)
- Chat App (WebSocket + Zustand)
- Blog CMS (Next.js + MDX + Auth)
- Trello Clone (Drag-n-drop, Zustand)
- E-commerce SPA (Cart, Filters, Pagination)
- Job Board with Infinite Scroll & Filters

---

## 🧠 Final Preparation (Mock + System Design)

### ✅ System Design:

- How to architect a large-scale React app
- Component Communication Tree
- SSR (Next.js) vs CSR architecture
- Lazy loading per route/module
- Auth Flow: OAuth2 + Token Storage

### ✅ Mock Interview Scenarios:

- "You're building a Slack clone — how would you design the UI architecture?"
