🔹 **Must-Know:** **Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer, Adapter, Proxy, Decorator, Composite, Flyweight, Template Method, Command, Chain of Responsibility.**

🔹 **Nice-to-Know (But Rarely Asked):** Memento, State, Visitor, Mediator, Interpreter, Bridge.

# **🔥 FAANG-Level Design Patterns Roadmap**

## **🔥 1. Core OOP Principles (Before Learning Design Patterns)**

✅ **SOLID Principles** (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Injection)

✅ **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) & KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

✅ **Composition over Inheritance**

✅ **Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Inheritance**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Refactor a **badly written codebase** to follow **SOLID** principles.

✔ Implement **Dependency Injection** in Java using **Spring Boot**.

---

## **🔥 2. Creational Design Patterns (Object Creation)**

✅ **Singleton** → **Global shared instance (Thread-Safe Singleton, Enum Singleton, Lazy vs Eager Initialization)**

✅ **Factory Method** → **Encapsulating Object Creation (Factory Pattern, Abstract Factory)**

✅ **Builder** → **Step-by-step object construction (Immutable Objects, Fluent Interface)**

✅ **Prototype** → **Cloning objects instead of creating new instances (Shallow vs Deep Copy)**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ **How do you make a Singleton thread-safe?**

2️⃣ **When should you use Factory Pattern vs Builder Pattern?**

3️⃣ **How would you design an object cache using Prototype Pattern?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Implement **Singleton in a Multithreaded environment (With Double-Checked Locking)**

✔ Create a **Logger using Factory Pattern**

✔ Build a **User Profile Generator with Builder Pattern**

---

## **🔥 3. Structural Design Patterns (Class & Object Composition)**

✅ **Adapter** → **Convert one interface to another (Connecting Incompatible Interfaces)**

✅ **Decorator** → **Dynamically adding behavior to objects (Extending Functionality Without Modifying Original Code)**

✅ **Proxy** → **Controlling access to objects (Virtual Proxy, Protection Proxy, Logging, Security)**

✅ **Composite** → **Tree-like structure (Building Hierarchical Object Structures)**

✅ **Flyweight** → **Optimizing memory usage for repeated objects (String Pool, Caching)**

✅ **Facade** → **Simplifying complex subsystems (Hiding Implementation Details)**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ **What is the difference between Proxy and Adapter?**

2️⃣ **When should you use a Decorator instead of Inheritance?**

3️⃣ **How does Flyweight help reduce memory usage?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Implement a **Cache System using Flyweight Pattern**

✔ Use **Decorator Pattern to Add Features to a Coffee Shop Ordering System**

✔ Implement **Proxy Pattern for Lazy Loading Large Objects**

---

## **🔥 4. Behavioral Design Patterns (Object Communication & Behavior)**

✅ **Strategy** → **Encapsulating algorithms (Choosing Different Sorting Algorithms at Runtime)**

✅ **Observer** → **Event-driven programming (Publish-Subscribe Model, UI Event Handling)**

✅ **Command** → **Encapsulating requests as objects (Undo/Redo, Macro Commands)**

✅ **Template Method** → **Defining the structure of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to customize behavior**

✅ **Chain of Responsibility** → **Passing requests along a chain of handlers (Logging, Middleware, Request Processing)**

✅ **State** → **Managing object state changes dynamically (Finite State Machines, UI Components)**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ **How does Strategy Pattern help remove if-else conditions?**

2️⃣ **What is the difference between Observer and Pub-Sub?**

3️⃣ **How would you implement Undo-Redo using the Command Pattern?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Implement **Strategy Pattern for a Payment Gateway (Credit Card, UPI, PayPal)**

✔ Design a **Notification System using Observer Pattern**

✔ Implement **Command Pattern for Undo/Redo in a Text Editor**

## **🔥 5. Low-Level Design (LLD) – FAANG System Design Approach**

LLD **focuses on designing real-world applications using OOP, Design Patterns, and Best Practices.**

### **🔥 5.1 Object-Oriented Design for FAANG**

✅ **Design Principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Composition Over Inheritance)**

✅ **Interface Segregation & Dependency Injection**

✅ **Applying Design Patterns to Real-World Problems**

---

### **🔥 5.2 FAANG-Level LLD Questions**

🔹 **Design a Parking Lot** → (Use Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Observer)

🔹 **Design a Library Management System** → (Use Factory, Composite, Observer)

🔹 **Design a Hotel Booking System** → (Use Builder, Strategy, State)

🔹 **Design an ATM Machine** → (Use State, Factory, Chain of Responsibility)

🔹 **Design a Logging Framework** → (Use Chain of Responsibility, Factory)

🔹 **Design a Cache System** → (Use Flyweight, Proxy, Decorator)

🔹 **Design an E-commerce Shopping Cart** → (Use Strategy, Observer, Decorator)

🔹 **Design a URL Shortener** → (Use Factory, Singleton)

---

### **🔥 6. LLD Mock Interview Preparation**

1️⃣ **Mock Interviews:** **Implement FAANG LLD problems under time constraints**

2️⃣ **Code Reviews:** **Refactor LLD solutions for scalability & maintainability**

3️⃣ **Real-World Systems:** **Analyze architectures of Uber, Netflix, Amazon**
