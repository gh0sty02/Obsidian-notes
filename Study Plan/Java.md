- hashCode, equals

**Scenarios:**

- What happens when you access an array out of bounds?

- Constructor chaining and inheritance pitfalls

### 🔹 JVM Internals

- JVM Architecture: ClassLoader, Method Area, Heap, Stack, Native Stack, PC Register

**Scenarios:**

- How does the JVM behave when two classloaders load the same class?
- Performance impact of frequent reflection usage

- Escape Analysis, Stack Allocation
- Reference Types: Strong, Soft, Weak, Phantom
- Java Serialization & Deserialization

**Scenarios:**

- TLAB behavior under frequent object creation

### 📌 Practice

- Use tools like `jconsole`, `jvisualvm`, `YourKit`, `JFR`
- Analyze heap dumps, GC logs, and thread dumps
- JVM tuning via flags: `Xms`, `Xmx`, `XX:+UseG1GC`, etc.

## 📂 **2. Collections Framework (Internals & Advanced Concepts)**

### 🔹 Core Collections

Note: **Study Data structure & Algorithm used by each collection interface/class internally and their time complexity**

- List: ArrayList, LinkedList
- Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
- Map: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
- Queue: PriorityQueue, Deque
- EnumMap, IdentityHashMap, WeakHashMap
- Comparator, Comparable

**Scenarios:**

- HashMap behavior with high load factor and hash collisions

- BlockingQueue, ConcurrentLinkedQueue, DelayQueue
- ConcurrentSkipListMap, ConcurrentSkipListSet
- Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe Iterators

**Scenarios:**

- Behavior of ConcurrentHashMap during key iteration and mutation
- CopyOnWriteArrayList performance tradeoff under high write load
- BlockingQueue behavior with full capacity

### 🔹 Hands-On

- Implement HashMap/LinkedList from scratch
- Performance tuning (load factor, initial capacity)
- Test concurrent access to custom data structures
