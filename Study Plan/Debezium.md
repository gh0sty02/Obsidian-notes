## **🔥 1. CDC Fundamentals**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **What is CDC (Change Data Capture)** – Concepts & Benefits

✅ **CDC Patterns** – Log-based, Trigger-based, Query-based

✅ **Transactional Logs** – Binlog (MySQL), WAL (Postgres), Oplog (MongoDB), SQL Server Transaction Log

✅ **Event Streaming vs ETL** – How CDC differs from batch ETL

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What is **Change Data Capture**, and why is it better than full-table replication?

2️⃣ Explain **log-based CDC vs trigger-based CDC**.

3️⃣ How does CDC ensure **exactly-once or at-least-once semantics**?

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Inspect a **database binlog or WAL** and identify change events.

✔ Compare **batch ETL vs CDC-based replication** for latency and throughput.

## **🔥 2. Debezium Architecture**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Debezium Connectors** – MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, SQL Server, Oracle

✅ **Kafka Connect Integration** – How Debezium runs on Kafka Connect

✅ **Event Flow** – DB → Connector → Kafka Topic → Consumer

✅ **Connector Offsets & Recovery** – How Debezium tracks last processed DB log position

✅ **Snapshot Mode** – Initial snapshot vs incremental streaming

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ How does Debezium track **database changes and offsets**?

2️⃣ Explain **Debezium’s snapshot vs incremental streaming**.

3️⃣ How does Debezium integrate with **Kafka Connect** for scalability?

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Set up a **Debezium MySQL connector** to stream changes to Kafka.

✔ Examine **Kafka topics created by Debezium** and check event payloads.

---

## **🔥 3. Event Structure & Schema Management**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Debezium Event Format** – before/after, op codes, source metadata

✅ **Serialization Formats** – JSON, Avro, Protobuf

✅ **Schema Registry Integration** – Versioning & evolution

✅ **Single Message Transforms (SMTs)** – Enrich, filter, or route events

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What is included in a typical **Debezium change event**?

2️⃣ How do you handle **schema evolution** without breaking consumers?

3️⃣ What are **SMTs**, and how do they work internally?

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Stream events in **Avro format** and register schemas in Schema Registry.

✔ Apply **SMTs** to enrich data before publishing to Kafka topics.

---

## **🔥 4. Reliability & Fault Tolerance**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Offset Management** – Stored in Kafka, exactly-once recovery

✅ **Connector Failure Recovery** – Resuming from last offset

✅ **Error Handling & DLQ** – Dead Letter Queue for poison messages

✅ **Backpressure Handling** – Throttling high-volume tables

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ How does Debezium **resume from failure** without missing events?

2️⃣ How do you handle **poison pill messages** in CDC pipelines?

3️⃣ What is the role of **Kafka consumer lag monitoring** for Debezium?

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Simulate **connector downtime** and verify automatic recovery.

✔ Configure a **DLQ for failed events** and test poison-pill handling.

---

## **🔥 5. Scaling & Performance**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Partitioning Strategy for Kafka Topics** – By primary key for ordering

✅ **Batching & Compression** – LZ4/Snappy to optimize throughput

✅ **High-Volume Table Handling** – Snapshot tuning, incremental streaming

✅ **Multi-Connector Deployment** – Parallel connectors for multiple tables/databases

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ How do you **scale Debezium for very large tables**?

2️⃣ What Kafka configurations **impact throughput for CDC events**?

3️⃣ How do you maintain **message ordering per key**?

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Configure **parallel connectors for multiple tables**.

✔ Tune **snapshot and batch configurations** to handle millions of events/hour.

---

## **🔥 6. Advanced CDC & Event-Driven Architecture**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Exactly-Once Semantics** – Kafka transactions for CDC consumers

✅ **Reprocessing & Replay** – Handling historical events

✅ **Integration with Microservices** – Event-driven architectures using CDC

✅ **Monitoring & Observability** – Metrics, connector health, lag, error rates

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ How do you **achieve exactly-once processing** with Debezium and Kafka?

2️⃣ How do you **reprocess CDC events safely**?

3️⃣ What metrics are critical to **monitor CDC pipelines**?

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Implement a **transactional Kafka consumer** to process Debezium events.

✔ Build a **microservice that reacts to DB changes in real-time**.

---

## **🔥 7. FAANG-Level Best Practices**

✅ **Use Kafka topics per table with key-based partitioning**

✅ **Enable schema evolution with Schema Registry**

✅ **DLQ for poison messages and error handling**

✅ **Monitor connector offsets and consumer lag**

✅ **Plan for snapshot & incremental streaming for large datasets**

✅ **Secure pipeline using SSL/SASL**

---

If you want, I can also **draw a full FAANG-level CDC + Debezium architecture diagram** showing **database → Debezium connector → Kafka topics → consumers → DLQ & schema registry**, which makes the **entire pipeline visually crystal clear**.

Do you want me to do that?
