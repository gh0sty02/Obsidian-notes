## **🔥 Final Steps to FAANG-Level HLD Mastery 🚀**

🔹 **Focus on Scalability & Distributed Systems (More than Just APIs & Databases)**

🔹 **Understand Real-World Architectures (Google, Uber, Netflix, Amazon)**

🔹 **Practice System Design Mock Interviews (Explain Trade-offs, Draw Diagrams, Justify Decisions)**

🔹 **Analyze How to Scale a System Step-by-Step (1 Million → 100 Million Users)**

---

### **🔥 Estimations**

✅ **Yes, estimations are crucial for FAANG interviews** because:

1️⃣ **They help define system scale and constraints** (e.g., how much storage, how many servers).

2️⃣ **They guide architectural decisions** (e.g., SQL vs NoSQL, caching strategies, replication).

3️⃣ **They show your ability to think in terms of real-world trade-offs.**

---

## **🔥 What Estimations Should You Know?**

### **1️⃣ Traffic Estimations**

🔹 **Requests per second (RPS)** → How many requests hit your system every second?

🔹 **Peak Traffic vs Average Traffic** → Does traffic spike during certain hours?

🔹 **Read vs Write Ratio** → Are reads more frequent than writes? (e.g., 90% read, 10% write)

🔹 **Concurrency** → How many users are using the system at the same time?

✔ **Example:**

- **Twitter:** 500M tweets per day → ~5,800 RPS
- **WhatsApp:** 100B messages per day → ~1.2M RPS

---

### **2️⃣ Storage Estimations**

🔹 **Data size per request** → How much data does each request store?

🔹 **Retention period** → How long do we need to store the data?

🔹 **Replication factor** → How many copies of data are kept for redundancy?

✔ **Example:**

- Each tweet is **280 characters (~300 bytes)**
- 500M tweets/day → **150GB/day**
- Retention for **5 years** → **273TB total storage**

---

### **3️⃣ Bandwidth & Network Estimations**

🔹 **How much data flows in and out per second?**

🔹 **Upload/download speed required?**

🔹 **Impact on load balancers & CDN?**

✔ **Example:**

- A YouTube 1080p video is **5MB/min**
- If **1M users stream at once**, total bandwidth = **83Gbps**

---

### **4️⃣ Database Estimations**

🔹 **How many rows/documents are inserted per second?**

🔹 **Sharding strategy based on data size?**

🔹 **Index size impact on queries?**

✔ **Example:**

- If 1M users log in daily and store **100KB** of metadata each,
    - DB grows by **100GB/day**
    - Need **partitioning or sharding after a few TB**

---

### **5️⃣ Cache & CDN Estimations**

🔹 **How much cache memory is needed to store hot data?**

🔹 **Cache hit ratio (e.g., 80% cache hits)?**

🔹 **Latency impact if cache misses?**

✔ **Example:**

- If a website serves **10M requests/day**
- 80% cache hit rate → only **2M requests go to DB**

---

## **🔥 Do FAANG Interviews Ask for Estimations?**

✅ **Yes!** If you're designing systems like **Twitter, Netflix, or Uber**, you must estimate:

1️⃣ **How many users?**

2️⃣ **How much data per second?**

3️⃣ **How many machines are needed?**

---

## **🔥 Practice Estimation Problems**

🔹 Estimate storage needs for a **video streaming service** like YouTube

🔹 Estimate **RPS for a messaging app** like WhatsApp

🔹 Estimate **bandwidth required for a real-time game server**

🔹 Estimate **cache size needed for a social media feed**
