✅ **PostgreSQL Schema, Tables, and Constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check, NOT NULL, DEFAULT)**

✅ **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF) and Denormalization**

✅ **Views, Materialized Views, and Temporary Tables**

✅ **Stored Procedures, Functions, and Triggers**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What are **the key differences between PostgreSQL and MySQL?**

2️⃣ How does **PostgreSQL handle composite types and arrays?**

3️⃣ What is **the difference between a View and a Materialized View?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Create a **PostgreSQL schema with multiple tables using primary and foreign keys**.

✔ Implement **Materialized Views and compare their performance with normal views**.

## **🔥 2. PostgreSQL Architecture & Internals**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **PostgreSQL Process Model (Backend Process, Autovacuum, WAL Writer, Checkpointer, Background Writer)**

✅  PostgreSQL Memory Architecture 

✅ **PostgreSQL Storage (Heap Storage, TOAST, Tablespaces, Block Storage)**

✅ How writes and reads happens internally in postgres

✅ **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) & Tuple Visibility**

✅ **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) & Crash Recovery**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What is **MVCC, and how does PostgreSQL handle concurrent transactions?**

2️⃣ How does **PostgreSQL recover from a system crash using WAL?**

3️⃣ What are **TOAST tables, and when are they used?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Monitor **PostgreSQL background processes using system tools**.

✔ Observe **how PostgreSQL manages dead tuples using autovacuum**.

✅ HOT Tuples

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What is **the difference between B-Tree, GIN, and BRIN indexes?**

2️⃣ How does **PostgreSQL decide the best execution plan for a query?**

3️⃣ What are **Index-Only Scans, and when are they used?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Optimize **a slow query using different indexing strategies**.

✔ Use **EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query execution plans**.

---

## **🔥 4. PostgreSQL Transactions & Concurrency Control**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Savepoints & Nested Transactions**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What is **the difference between Read Committed and Serializable isolation levels?**

2️⃣ How does **PostgreSQL handle deadlocks, and how can you avoid them?**

3️⃣ What is **an Advisory Lock, and when should you use it?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Simulate **deadlocks and analyze their resolution using pg_stat_activity**.

✔ Implement **Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking in a multi-threaded environment**.

---

## **🔥 5. Query Optimization & Execution Planning**

### **Core Topics**

✅ **Join Algorithms (Nested Loop, Hash Join, Merge Join, Parallel Hash Join)**

✅ **Parallel Query Execution & Parallel Index Scans**

### **Practice Questions**

1️⃣ What is **the difference between Hash Join, Merge Join, and Nested Loop Join?**

2️⃣ How does **PostgreSQL decide the best execution plan for a query?**

### **Hands-On Practice**

✔ Analyze **execution plans of different join types on large datasets**.

---

## **🔥 6. Partitioning & Sharding in PostgreSQL**

### **Core Topics**
