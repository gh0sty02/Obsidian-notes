# 🧠 What is a Trie?

A **Trie (pronounced "try")** is a tree-like **prefix data structure** used for efficient retrieval of strings, especially when they share common prefixes — often used in problems involving:

- **Autocomplete**
- **Dictionary matching**
- **Prefix search**
- **Spell check**
- **IP routing (binary trie)**

---

## 📦 Real-world Analogy

Think of a **Trie like a phonebook**. If you want to find names starting with "Ann", you follow:

```plain text
Root → A → N → N

```

From there, all possible completions (Anna, Annie, Annabel) are below that node.

---

## 🔧 How a Trie Works Internally

Each Trie node typically stores:

```plain text
class TrieNode {
  Map<Character, TrieNode> children;
  boolean isEndOfWord;
}

```

Key operations:

1. **Insert(word)** – Add a word to the trie.
2. **Search(word)** – Check if exact word exists.
3. **StartsWith(prefix)** – Check if any word starts with a prefix.

---

## 👨‍💻 Basic Implementation (JavaScript-style pseudocode)

```plain text
class TrieNode {
  constructor() {
    this.children = {};     // Map of characters to children
    this.isEnd = false;     // End-of-word marker
  }
}

class Trie {
  constructor() {
    this.root = new TrieNode();
  }

  insert(word) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let ch of word) {
      if (!node.children[ch]) node.children[ch] = new TrieNode();
      node = node.children[ch];
    }
    node.isEnd = true;
  }

  search(word) {
    let node = this._traverse(word);
    return !!node && node.isEnd;
  }

  startsWith(prefix) {
    return !!this._traverse(prefix);
  }

  _traverse(str) {
    let node = this.root;
    for (let ch of str) {
      if (!node.children[ch]) return null;
      node = node.children[ch];
    }
    return node;
  }
}

```
