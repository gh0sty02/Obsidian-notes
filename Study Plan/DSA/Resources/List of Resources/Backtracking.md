### 🔹 BACKTRACKING CORE PATTERNS

| Pattern | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Subsets** | Include/exclude decision at each step |
| **2. Permutations** | All arrangements of elements |
| **3. Combinations** | Select `k` items from `n` |
| **4. Palindromes** | Partitioning or checking strings |
| **5. N-Queens / Grid Search** | Placing items on 2D grid with constraints |
| **6. Word/Path Search in Matrix** | DFS + backtracking |
| **7. Expression Add Operators** | Explore math expressions recursively |
| **8. Coloring / Graph State** | Coloring nodes or solving constraint satisfaction |
| **9. Bitmask Backtracking** | Optimize recursive state using bitmask |
| **10. Constraint Pruning** | Add conditions to reduce recursion (e.g., Sudoku) |

## 🧠 BEST PRACTICES FOR FAANG-LEVEL BACKTRACKING

1. **Draw the recursion tree** for intuition.
2. **Prune early** — this is key to improving performance.
3. **Use visited sets or bitmasking** to track state.
4. **Avoid duplicates** in subsets/permutations via sorting and skipping.
5. **Memoization + Backtracking** when state is overlapping (like bitmask + position).
